Clara Example
=============

A minimal example of using [Clara](https://github.com/tehapo/clara) to be used in an example in an upcoming blog entry.

Take a look at the [ClaraExampleUI.xml](https://github.com/tehapo/clara-blog-example/blob/master/src/main/resources/org/vaadin/teemu/ClaraExampleUI.xml) file to see how the declarative UI is written. Then look at [ClaraExampleUI.java](https://github.com/tehapo/clara-blog-example/blob/master/src/main/java/org/vaadin/teemu/ClaraExampleUI.java) to see how this XML is turned into Vaadin component hierarchy at runtime and also how the events are bound to these components using annotations.
